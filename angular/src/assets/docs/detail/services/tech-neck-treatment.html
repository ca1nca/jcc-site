<h4>An Occupational Cause of Neck Pain and Back Pain</h4>
<p>
  In the modern age of technology, it is common to spend long hours at
  the computer and&nbsp;on mobile devices. Due to this, we are seeing
  more and more incidences of a painful occupational hazard we call
  &quot;tech neck.&quot; Despite the amusing moniker,&nbsp;this
  condition is quite serious. If you suffer from neck pain, back pain,
  headaches and other debilitating symptoms, your work habits might be
  at fault. Fortunately, Dr. Viktorija Joga, our chiropractor serving
  West Los Angeles and Westchester, understands the
  biomechanics&nbsp;behind this condition and can offer various
  natural healing methods to help rid you of these symptoms.

  />Good posture is critical for maintaining healthy spinal alignment
  and musculoskeletal balance. Even small deviations eventually lead
  to chronic pain and stiffness. The cervical spine&nbsp;is
  particularly vulnerable to neural&nbsp;and muscular problems that
  stem from poor office ergonomics. If it is forced to support the
  weight of the skull in an off-balance position, muscle strain and
  nerve impingement can quickly follow. Unfortunately, long hours
  spent working at a computer often create the conditions necessary
  for tech neck, especially if your desk or monitor height requires
  you to adopt a &quot;head forward&quot; position.
</p>
<p>
  You shouldn&rsquo;t assume that you&#39;re immune to tech
  neck&nbsp;simply because you don&#39;t work at a desk.&nbsp;Many of
  today&#39;s tech workers enjoy freeing themselves from traditional
  desktop arrangements by using their laptops from the comfort of a
  couch or recliner. In reality, the result of this behavior can be
  anything but comfortable, as the lack of spinal support from these
  relaxed positions&nbsp;creates serious strain in the neck and back.
  Even mobile phone users can experience these problems. Constant
  texting places stress on the upper back and can cause
  carpal&nbsp;tunnel syndrome, &quot;tennis elbow&quot; and wrist
  pain. Workers who constantly crook their necks when talking on the
  phone can develop chronic neck stiffness and pain as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  It&#39;s worth noting that anything that affects nerve function in
  the cervical spine can produce symptoms above and beyond neck pain.
  For instance, you may experience headaches that are actually caused
  by strain on the cervical and thoracic regions of the spine.

  Our West Los Angeles and Westchester Chiropractor Can
  &quot;De-tech&quot; Your Neck
</h4>
<p>
  If you believe you may be suffering from tech neck, then it&#39;s
  time to schedule a consultation with our West Los Angeles and
  Westchester chiropractor. (Dr. Joga sees patients in both of our
  clinic locations.) You may have a longstanding misalignment in your
  cervical spine. Additionally, habitual poor posture may have
  initially contributed to misalignment. Either way, we can perform
  chiropractic adjustments to help restore proper vertical alignment.
</p>
<p>
  Other natural healing modalities such as massage therapy and
  corrective exercises can help relieve sore muscles, restore range of
  motion, and strengthen the neck to protect against future problems.
  We may also prescribe a &quot;Posture Medic&quot; support for extra
  daytime relief, or recommend ergonomic adjustments for healthier
  work conditions. Contact us to learn more!
