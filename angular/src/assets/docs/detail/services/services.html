  Chiropractic Care Services Available at Joga Chiropractic Center

<h6>Back Pain Treatment</h6>
<p>
  Acute back injuries can present in a number of different situations.
  Most commonly, patients suffer from back pain as a result of sports
  injuries, auto accidents and overuse situations at work. These
  injuries often include torn muscles, stretched ligaments and
  musculoskeletal misalignment. Common back pain issues include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sciatica</li>
  <li>Degenerative Disc Disease</li>
  <li>Herniated or Bulging Discs</li>
  <li>and More</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Using targeted chiropractic adjustments in combination with other
  treatment methods like massage therapy, we can help you manage your
  pain and find relief.
</p>
<h6>Pain Management</h6>
<p>
  Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons that patients visit
  our chiropractor each year. With complaints that range from neck and
  back pain to sciatica, fibromyalgia and other chronic pain
  conditions, recurring pain can have a great impact on how our
  patients live their day-to-day lives. Our experienced team is
  dedicated to working closely with each patient to target the source
  of your chronic pain symptoms and designing a treatment plan that
  eliminates the need for prescription pain medication.
</p>
<h6>Auto Accident Injury Treatment</h6>
<p>
  Auto accidents can result in many significant injuries to the neck
  and back. At Joga Chiropractic Center, our team has the experience
  necessary to treat a wide range of auto accident injuries including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whiplash</li>
  <li>Neck and Back Pain</li>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="conditions-treated/herniated-discs"
      >Herniated</a
    >
    or Bulging Discs
  </li>
  <li>Headaches and Migraines</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In many cases, auto accidents can cause injuries that do not present
  any symptoms for days or even weeks. If you have recently been
  involved in an auto accident, we highly recommend scheduling an
  initial exam with our chiropractor in Westchester to make sure you
  do not have any extensive injuries.
</p>
<h6>Prenatal Care</h6>
<p>
  Pregnancy requires a great deal of physical demand from expectant
  mothers. With many drastic changes to the female body and strain on
  the musculoskeletal system, prenatal chiropractic care is a great
  way to manage pregnancy discomfort and enhance your overall health
  for a safe and successful delivery. Using chiropractic adjustments
  in combination with specially designed massage therapy and other
  therapeutic treatment methods, we can bring balance to the body and
  reduce inflammation, back and neck pain, headaches and fatigue.
</p>
<h6>Massage Therapy</h6>
<p>
  When used in combination with spinal adjustments, massage therapy is
  a powerful tool for restoring balance to the body and relieving
  chronic pain symptoms. Massage therapy is also very relaxing for
  most patients and ideal for loosening tight or strained muscles.
  This helps to make chiropractic adjustments more effective and
  leaves you feeling great.
</p>
<h6>Graston Technique</h6>
<p>
  Offered by more than 16,000 medical practitioners across the globe,
  The Graston Technique has proven effective in treating the soft
  tissues in the body to break apart scar tissue and promote faster
  healing. Using specialized tools, Dr. Joga recommends this technique
  for patients experiencing Runner&rsquo;s Knee, Tennis Elbow, Plantar
  Fasciitis, Muscle Sprains and more.
</p>
<h6>Sports Chiropractor Care</h6>
<p>
  Athletic injuries can affect patients of all ages and skill levels.
  Whether you were playing a round of pickup basketball, hitting a few
  tennis balls or training for a marathon, sports injuries can be
  severe enough to leave you on the sidelines for weeks or months. By
  targeting the source of your pain, Dr. Joga can create a treatment
  plan that will take into consideration your specific lifestyle and
  training needs.
</p>
<h6>Senior Chiropractic Care</h6>
<p>
  Using gentle and target spinal adjustment, Dr. Joga and our
  experienced chiropractic team can help to alleviate years of pain
  and discomfort that tend to increase in severity as our patients
  grow older. Whether you are experiencing pain stemming from a
  previous injury or you&rsquo;ve noticed increasing discomfort in
  your back and hips over time, we are dedicated to helping our senior
  patients find pain relief. Through chiropractic manipulation, we can
  help to reduce pain and inflammation and promote a higher level of
  health and wellness.
