  <h2>Core Training</h2>
</header>

<p>
  If you are experiencing back pain, neck pain or other spinal issues,
  you may need more than just an adjustment from our chiropractor--
  you may need to strengthen your core muscles. These critical muscle
  groups seated around your center of gravity help support your body
  with every move you make. They also control your ability to maintain
  correct posture and alignment, a critical aspect of your overall
  health and wellness. So if you want to be healthy, you need the core
  training we provide here at Joga Chiropractic Center in West Los
  Angeles &amp; Westchester.

<p>
  Your body&rsquo;s core represents its center of gravity, an area
  surrounding the base of spine and extending from the bottom of the
  stomach to the top of the pelvis. This area is also known as your
  pivot point, because your entire body can pivot or bend from this
  part of the body and still retain its balance.
</p>
<p>
  The core muscles, which include several large muscle groups in the
  abdomen, lower back and pelvis, make this delicate balancing act
  possible. Every time you turn your body or move any of your limbs,
  your core muscles must compensate to stabilize your balance.
  Whenever you add weight to your spinal column&rsquo;s workload, your
  core muscles must provide enough resistance to keep you properly
  aligned. Even such mundane activities as standing, sitting down, or
  bending down to tie your shoes depend on core strength.
</p>
<p>
  If your core muscles fail to provide enough support, you can strain
  your back or throw your vertebrae out of alignment while performing
  even the simplest task. Spinal misalignments, whether caused or
  aggravated by muscular weakness, can leave you with chronic back
  pain, neck pain and other symptoms. To add insult to injury, these
  misalignments can cause pinched nerves which in turn weaken other
  muscles in your body. A weak core can even impair your respiratory
  and circulatory processes, leaving you feeling tired or listless and
  affecting your ability to resist illnesses.

  Our West Los Angeles &amp; Westchester Chiropractor Implements Core
  Training for Increase Body Wellness
</h4>
<p>
  The core training offered at Joga Chiropractic Center in West Los
  Angeles &amp; Westchester&nbsp;tones your core muscles to help you
  maintain a straight posture and avoid muscle pulls or other injuries
  caused by an off-kilter physique. First our chiropractor, Dr. Joga,
  evaluates your overall health and spinal alignment to come up with
  an exercise plan that matches your current state of health and
  muscle strength. Bridges, in which you flex your core muscles from a
  prone, lateral or supine position, are common core strength
  exercises. Other exercises may include pelvic thrusts, twists,
  lunges, or squats, sometimes with the aid of an exercise ball or
  weights.
