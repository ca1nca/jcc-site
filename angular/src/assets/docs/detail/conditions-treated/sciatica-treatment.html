<h4>What is Sciatica?</h4>

<p>
  Sciatica is a form of back pain that is related to the sciatic
  nerve. This nerve is located in the back of one or both of your
  legs. This nerve is tucked into the muscles of the buttocks, back of
  your thigh, and down into your foot. If this nerve gets pinched you
  will suffer from sciatica. Usually you will only experience sciatic
  pain in one leg or side of your buttocks.&nbsp;
</p>

<h4>Causes of Sciatica</h4>

<p>
  Individuals suffering from sciatic nerve pain typically have bone
  spurs or a herniated disc. These conditions lead to increased
  pressure and inflammation along the sciatic nerve. If you think you
  are suffering from sciatica, the cause of sciatica can be treated by
  our Westchester chiropractor at the Joga Chiropractic Center. Dr.
  Joga is well trained, highly skilled, and experienced with dealing
  with the cause of sciatica using chiropractic care.
</p>

<h4>Most Common Symptoms of Sciatic Nerve Pain</h4>

<p>
  If you are suffering from sciatica the most common symptoms of
  sciatic nerve pain are burning, tingling, weakness, or numbness.
  These symptoms will occur along the buttocks or backside of one or
  both of your legs. You may have difficulty standing, walking, or
  sitting because of your sciatic nerve pain. Dr. Joga can diagnose
  your sciatic nerve pain and provide you with a level of care and
  treatment plan. We look forward to helping you reduce the symptoms
  of sciatic nerve pain, while improving your overall wellness.&nbsp;
