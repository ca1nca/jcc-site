<h4><strong>Common Work Injuries</strong></h4>
<p>
  The injuries that a person may face depends largely on the type of
  work that they do. Construction workers or those who have very
  physical jobs are more susceptible to overexertion injuries. These
  occur when lifting incorrectly, pushing and pulling heavy loads or
  throwing items. Slipping or tripping on wet floors or over objects
  on the ground is common in restaurant-type jobs.
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;Other injuries include falling from heights, like ladders or
  roofs, walking-into injuries or getting hit by falling objects. In
  an office-type environment, many people suffer from repetitive
  motion injuries. These problems can be caused by excessive typing or
  heavy computer use and can cause issues like strained muscles and
  back or neck pain. Work or accident injuries may result in
  migraines, chronic back or neck aches, strains, sprains and more.
</p>
<h4>Chiropractic Care for Work Injury</h4>
<p>
  Working with an experienced chiropractor, like Dr. Joga, can help
  quickly and safely alleviate your workplace injuries. Chiropractors
  use hands-on physical manipulations in order to increase blood flow
  and circulation to the injured area, which helps it heal faster.
  Focusing on the spine and nervous system, chiropractors pay special
  attention to aligning the spinal area, which helps the entire body
  function better.
</p>
<p>
  With the help of holistic, chiropractic care, patients can restore
  mobility and range of motion in affected areas, like the back,
  shoulders, neck or knees. Dr. Joga regularly treats work injuries
  like disc herniations, sciatica, pinched nerves, and whiplash.
</p>
<h4>How Our Los Angeles Chiropractor Can Help</h4>
<p>
  Dr. Joga works with a variety of patients, including athletes,
  pregnant women and those suffering from work or accident-related
  injuries. She believes in a whole-person approach to her practice,
  in which she strives to treat the underlying issues instead of
  masking the symptoms. After a physical examination and discussion,
  Dr. Joga formulates a plan based on the individual&rsquo;s specific
  needs and goals. In addition to chiropractic care, she utilizes
  massage therapy, the Rocktape technique, the Graston technique and
  may advise patients to perform corrective exercises at home,
  designed to strengthen and rehabilitate the body.
