  />A Los Angeles whiplash injury can leave you with chronic pain and
  restricted mobility for months or even years after the accident
  occurs. You do not need to be in a serious car accident to suffer
  from this pain. Accidents at speeds as slow as 5mph can cause
  serious damage to the musculoskeletal system. At Joga Chiropractic
  Center, our West Los Angeles and Westchester chiropractor offers the
  latest in whiplash injury pain management. By following a whole body
  approach to whiplash injury treatment, we treat the root cause for
  your pain, delivering long-lasting pain relief while supporting your
  body&rsquo;s natural healing process.

<h4>Whiplash Injury Pain Management &amp; Rehabilitation</h4>

<p>
  A whiplash injury occurs when the force of a rear-impact accident
  &ldquo;whips&rdquo; the cervical spine beyond its normal range of
  motion, abruptly knocking the neck backwards and forwards. This
  whipping acting can knock the spine out of alignment, causing nerve
  compression and straining the muscles. Common symptoms of whiplash
  injury include neck pain, headaches at the base of the neck,
  soreness and stiffness in the neck, difficulty concentrating on
  simple tasks, and difficulty sleeping at night. While medication can
  relieve the immediate pain you may be experiencing, drugs are
  limited in their ability to deliver long-lasting pain relief. Once
  the medication wears off, your pain will return. That&rsquo;s no way
  to live your life!
</p>

<p>
  Chiropractic adjustments are an effective, drug-free pain treatment
  option that relieves your pain by directly addressing the root
  cause. Unlike medication that only &ldquo;covers up&rdquo; pain
  symptoms, adjustments correct the underlying spinal misalignment
  that is compressing the nerves and causing your pain. Our gentle
  adjustments are safe and effective for individuals of all ages.
  Cervical spine adjustments correct the underlying cause for your
  pain &ndash; a cervical spine misalignment &shy;&ndash; by reducing
  nerve compression.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to chiropractic adjustments, you may also benefit from
  complementary therapies like massage therapy. Therapeutic massage of
  the neck and shoulders relieves tension trapped within the muscles
  following a whiplash injury. If you find it painful to turn your
  neck from side to side, for example, massage can help restore your
  natural mobility. Massage brings fresh, oxygen-rich blood to the
  injured soft tissues, which supports your body&rsquo;s natural
  healing process.

  After a car accident, prompt whiplash injury treatment can help
  speed the recovery process and prevent the development of long-term
  pain. If you have recently been in a car accident, a diagnostic exam
  with our West Los Angeles and Westchester chiropractor Dr. Joga is
  the best way to determine the extent of your whiplash injuries and
  the appropriate treatment course. Dr. Joga customizes all of her
  treatment programs to your specific pain management and injury
  rehabilitation needs. This includes corrective care exercises for
  safely restoring a full range of mobility to the cervical spine
  while minimizing inflammation and swelling that can aggravate pain.
