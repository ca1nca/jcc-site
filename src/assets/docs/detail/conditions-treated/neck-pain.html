<h2 class="header">Neck Pain</h2>
<p>
  Do you suffer from recurring&nbsp;neck pain? Whether your pain is
  due to a whiplash injury or poor posture, chronic&nbsp;neck
  pain&nbsp;can have a serious impact on your quality of life,
  affecting your ability to be productive at work, enjoy your favorite
  activities and even sleep through the night. Chiropractic
  adjustments are a safe, effective alternative to medication and
  surgery for neck&nbsp;pain relief.

<h4>Chiropractic Care Manages&nbsp;Neck Pain: No Drugs or Surgery</h4>

  You do not need to be in a major car accident to sustain a whiplash
  injury, which is a leading cause for&nbsp;neck pain. Even a minor
  fender bender at speeds as slow as 5 mph can &ldquo;whip&rdquo; the
  neck backwards and forwards, causing a cervical spine misalignment.
  When the cervical spine is out of alignment, pressure from the
  misalignment can compress nearby nerves and muscles,
  triggering&nbsp;neck pain, headaches, and other health problems. If
  the RCPM muscle is compressed, for example, this can trigger
  recurring headaches. Symptoms of a whiplash injury include&nbsp;neck
  pain, fatigue, dizziness, jaw pain and difficulty sleeping at night.
</p>

<p>
  If you are suffering&nbsp;neck pain&nbsp;from a whiplash injury,
  our&nbsp;West Los Angeles and
  Westchester&nbsp;chiropractor&nbsp;will create a custom treatment
  program to naturally manage this pain. The first step for
  effective&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="services/pain-management"
    >pain management</a
  >
  is to identify the root cause. Our&nbsp;chiropractor in West Los
  Angeles and Westchester&nbsp;will conduct diagnostic tests to
  determine the extent of your cervical spine misalignment. Next, we
  use hands-on chiropractic adjustments to gently decompress the spine
  and create space between the vertebrae, alleviating pressure on the
  nerves and providing long-lasting&nbsp;pain relief.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to
  <a target="_blank" href="services/">chiropractic adjustments</a>,
  patients may also benefit from complementary therapies, including
  massage therapy and therapeutic exercises. Massage therapy can be
  very beneficial for releasing tension trapped deep within the
  fascia, allowing the body to relax while also boosting the level of
  pain-killing endorphins. Corrective care exercises are also
  beneficial for restoring mobility to the neck after an injury. If
  your neck is stiff or sore, our corrective exercises are a safe way
  to bring back a natural range of motion without risking injury.
</p>

<p>
  While&nbsp;neck pain&nbsp;is frequently due to a whiplash injury,
  poor posture can also be a primary contributing factor. When you
  hunch over a keyboard to see your computer screen or slump back in a
  chair with the laptop on your knees, your spine is placed in a
  &ldquo;C&rdquo; position. This pushes the head forward while the
  hips tip back, causing spinal compression. Now imagine assuming this
  position for eight hours every day while at work &ndash; it&rsquo;s
  no surprise that chronic neck pain is one of the most common
  workplace complaints. Our&nbsp;West Los Angeles and Westchester
  chiropractor&nbsp;can help you make simple ergonomic adjustments to
  relieve this pain.
