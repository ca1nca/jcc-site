  we work with patients facing a wide range of pain types. It is
  always our goal to help you feel your best. When you come in to meet

  types of pain you have including fibromyalgia.
</p>

<h4>What Is Fibromyalgia?</h4>

<p>
  Fibromyalgia is a condition in which a person experiences widespread
  musculoskeletal pain. Research indicates that the condition causes
  pain sensations to be amplified by impacting the way the brain
  processes pain signals. The condition can occur to anyone, but it is
  more common in women. The condition may develop over time or may
  occur after a particular trauma or significantly stressful event
  occurs. In all situations, it generally is a heightened sensitivity
  to pain brought about by unbalanced nerve responses to pain signals.
</p>

<h4>Symptoms of Fibromyalgia</h4>

<p>
  The symptoms of fibromyalgia can differ from one person to the next.
  Most commonly they include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Pain that&#39;s widespread, often a dull ache that seems to occur
    on both sides of the body both above and below the waist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fatigue that&#39;s chronic and often due to disrupted sleep from
    pain or conditions such as restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cognitive limitations such as a foggy mind, trouble concentrating,
    and difficulty focusing.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Many people with this condition also suffer from other concerns such
  as irritable bowel syndrome, TMJ, and migraines.
</p>

<h4>Fibromyalgia Treatment from Your Chiropractor</h4>

<p>
  Chiropractic care offers a noninvasive treatment option. Our
  fibromyalgia treatment works to reduce the subluxations and other
  spinal abnormalities that could be causing the pain signals. When
  you visit your chiropractor in our office, we will discuss with you
  what your symptoms are. We&#39;ll then provide a full examination of
  the spinal column that may include x-rays.
</p>

<p>
  From there, we can work to improve the alignment of the spinal
  column to reduce pressure and inflammation on nerve roots that are
  sending these pain signals to the brain. In this way, we are able to
  reduce the impact of the condition by reducing the impact on nerve
  endings and roots in this region. Even if your pain is
  muscle-related, it is often these poor pain signals traveling from
  that area to the brain that cause the pain sensitivity you have.
</p>

<p>
  Spinal manipulation through the use of gentle force helps us to
  properly align the spinal column, reducing the impact on every one
  of the nerves in your spinal cord. Over time, this reduces the pain
  signals being sent to the brain while also reducing the presence of
  inflammation. There is no cure for fibromyalgia, but we can treat
  it.
