<p>
  When you're on the field or court, it's possible for you to sustain
  an injury. Even just going for a run could put you at risk for
  getting hurt. As long as your body is moving, you're at risk for
  injury. Pain medications ease your discomfort, but they don't treat
  the problem like a chiropractor from Joga Chiropractic Center can.

<h4>
  About Sports Injuries
</h4>
<p>
  Any type of injury you sustain while you're participating in
  physical activity counts as a sports-related injury. Two of the more
  common injuries are sprains and strains, which can happen anywhere
  in your body where you have soft tissue. Strains occur when you
  damage your muscles. The muscle either tears or stretches too much.
  Sprains, on the other hand, occur when the ligaments tear, twist, or
  pull apart.&nbsp;Generally, if you're experiencing difficulty
  moving, you have a strain. Swelling tends to occur more frequently
  with sprains.&nbsp;The most common injuries occur in the ankles,
  knees, and feet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  You could have back pain from a fall or overexerting your back. Head
  injuries are also possible from sports, in particular, football. In
  contact sports, it's possible to suffer from whiplash or spinal
  injuries.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Treating Sports Injuries
</h4>
<p>
  Our chiropractor treats sports injuries based on the type of injury
  you have. For instance, we may use a spinal alignment if you have a
  back injury. This treatment realigns the spine, so both the discs
  and vertebrae are in line with one another.&nbsp;We use it for neck
  injuries like whiplash as well.&nbsp;It also promotes blood flow
  throughout the area to promote healing.&nbsp;We use it for neck
  injuries like whiplash as well.&nbsp;Spinal decompression is another
  treatment we use for back injuries. During this particular process,
  our chiropractor situates you on a table where you're connected to
  pulleys. They gently pull your spine from two different directions
  to pull the vertebrae apart and allow the discs to heal.

<p>
  We may fit you for a brace to stabilize an area if you sustained an
  injury. We use massage therapy to relieve tension and lessen your
  pain and discomfort. Our massage therapist reaches the soft tissue
  deep inside of your body. This therapy enhances blood flow to the
  area as well. Our chiropractor might also prescribe exercise therapy
  to work the muscles and other soft tissue. The treatment consists of
  our chiropractor guiding you through exercises that work the soft
  tissue slowly. The exercises increase flexibility and help a person
  regain function in that area.
