  When you have Joga&nbsp;Chiropractic Center on your side, you have a
  potent ally in the fight against a wide range of health challenges.
  Our chiropractor in Westchester CA, Dr. Viktorija&nbsp;Joga, can
  prescribe multiple healing modalities to address conditions such as:
</p>
<h4>
  <a target="_blank" href="conditions-treated/back-pain"
    ><strong>Back Pain</strong></a
  >
</h4>
<p>
  Upper or lower back pain may be caused by everything from muscle
  strain and disc problems to chronic misalignment or even pregnancy.
  We can ease your pain through core training sessions (to strengthen
  your back muscles), chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy and
  more.
</p>
<h4>
  <a target="_blank" href="conditions-treated/neck-pain"
    ><strong>Neck Pain</strong></a
  >
</h4>
<p>
  &nbsp;From the posture-related pain of &quot;tech neck&quot; to the
  acute agony of whiplash, neck pain can involve discs, vertebrae,
  muscles,&nbsp;connective tissues and/or&nbsp;cervical nerve roots.
  Our gentle, precise chiropractic techniques can restore proper
  cervical alignment. Massage can soothe injured or tense neck
  muscles.
</p>
<h4><strong>Shoulder or Knee Pain</strong></h4>
<p>
  Shoulder and knee joints can take a lot of punishment, suffering
  from tendinitis, bursitis and other problems as a result. We can
  correct your musculoskeletal&nbsp;balance and prescribe
  rehabilitative exercises and physiotherapy to restore normal joint
  function.
</p>
<h4><strong>Herniated Disc</strong></h4>
<p>
  A herniated disc can protrude onto nearby nerves, causing pain and
  other neurological symptoms. Chiropractic adjustments can help guide
  the disc back into a more normal configuration, while our core
  training programs can help strengthen the muscles that support a
  more disc-healthy posture.
</p>
<h4><strong>Degenerative Disc Disease</strong></h4>
<p>
  Over time, discs naturally lose some of their hydration, causing
  them to flatten out in a way that stresses the spinal joints. Our
  chiropractic techniques can help lessen the pressure on degenerated
  discs, minimizing the effects on your spinal column and comfort.
</p>
<h4><strong>Spinal Stenosis</strong></h4>
<p>
  Spinal&nbsp;stenosis is a narrowing of the bony &quot;canal&quot;
  that houses your spinal cord, creating&nbsp;nerve compression and
  neurological dysfunction. Our chiropractor in Westchester can
  adjust&nbsp;the spine to optimize the amount of available space
  within the spinal canal.
</p>
<h4><strong>Pinched Nerves</strong></h4>
<p>
  A pinched nerve will pass abnormal&nbsp;nerve signals, producing
  pain, &quot;pins and needles&quot; sensations, lack of motor control
  and other problems. Chiropractic treatment can shift errant spinal
  structures back into their proper place -- away from your sensitive
  nerve tissue.
</p>
<h4><strong>Sciatica</strong></h4>
<p>
  Sciatica occurs when sciatic nerve roots are impinged by herniated
  discs or other spinal abnormalities. It causes lower back pain as
  well as tingling, numbness, pain or weakness in the legs. Our
  chiropractor in Westchester can administer careful adjustments to
  release the compressed sciatic nerve roots, eliminating your
  symptoms without drugs.
</p>
<h4><strong>Personal Injuries</strong></h4>
<p>
  Personal injuries can cover everything from slip-and-fall incidents
  to workplace mishaps that leave you with back pain, neck pain or
  extremity pain. We can prescribe a comprehensive course of core
  training, therapeutic massage, and chiropractic treatment to help
  you recuperate more quickly and fully.
</p>
<h4>
  <a target="_blank" href="services/auto-accident-injury-care"
    ><strong>Auto Accident Injuries</strong></a
  >
</h4>
<p>
  Auto accident injuries can create a perfect storm of
  acute&nbsp;health problems, from whiplash and sciatica to shoulder
  damage and seat belt injuries. Untreated auto injuries can promote
  internal scarring (adhesions) that leave you in constant pain. We
  can prescribe a holistic auto accident treatment that includes
  massage therapy, chiropractic adjustment,
  Graston&nbsp;Technique&nbsp;(to break up scar tissue), and core
  training to restore your physical function.
</p>
<h4><strong>Arthritis and Other Joint Pain Conditions</strong></h4>
<p>
  Joint pain conditions such as arthritis or old, nagging injuries can
  leave you suffering from chronic&nbsp;inflammation and stiffness.
  Our chiropractic techniques can help optimize the position of joint
  components. Massage can relieve inflammatory pain, while core
  training can help maintain a straighter posture, thus minimizing
  abnormal joint stress.
</p>
<h4><strong>Fibromyalgia</strong></h4>
<p>
  Fibromyalgia is believed to be the result of neurotransmitter
  imbalances that greatly amplify the body&#39;s responses to pain
  signals. This syndrome can cause painful muscle knots, headaches,
  insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome and many other problems. We
  can&nbsp;treat your discomfort through such treatments as massage
  therapy to break up muscle knots, chiropractic adjustments to
  normalize nerve function (and treat spinal stenosis, a common issue
  in fibromyalgia sufferers).
</p>
<h4><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong></h4>
<p>
  Carpal tunnel syndrome is an inflammation of the space containing
  the median nerve. This problem pinches the nerve that serves your
  thumb and first three fingers. We can prescribe chiropractic
  adjustments to the wrist bones, massage therapy, lifestyle changes,
  and other non-surgical solutions for this condition.
</p>
<h4><strong>Ergonomic Issues</strong></h4>
<p>
  Poor workplace ergonomics can put your posture at risk, resulting in
  painful conditions such as tech neck. Our chiropractor in
  Westchester can identify the specific reasons for your distress can
  prescribe tech neck treatment, core training, massage, and
  suggestions for changing your everyday work habits and environment.
