<h4>Common Causes&nbsp;&amp; Symptoms of&nbsp;Lower Back Pain</h4>

<p>
  Our patients with lower back pain often complain of dull or achy
  pain in the low back and buttocks,&nbsp;spinal stiffness, decreased
  mobility in their hamstrings and hip flexors (e.g., they can&#39;t
  touch their toes), muscle tenderness, and decreased
  tolerance&nbsp;to exercising, sitting, or standing. If a nerve is
  being compressed somewhere in their spine, they may also complain of
  numbness, weakness, tingling and nerve pain (often feels like
  burning, shooting, stabbing, radiating, or searing) in whichever leg
  is partially innervated by the affected nerve. These symptoms can
  worsen depending on several factors including time of day, whether a
  person gains excessive weight, or if the patient has a physically
  demanding job or (alternatively) a highly sedentary lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
  Specific diagnoses which we can identify during a comprehensive
  initial consultation (based on patient and family history, symptom
  presentation, and physical tests)&nbsp;include:&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arthritis</li>
  <li>Fibromyalgia</li>
  <li>Stenosis</li>
  <li>
    Lumbar radiculopathy (nerve compression, often called sciatica if
    the sciatic nerve is being compressed)
  </li>
  <li>Disc herniation or bulge</li>
  <li>Spinal ligament sprains&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Muscle strains and spasms</li>
  <li>Spinal joint misalignments and acute locks</li>
</ul>

<h4>
  How Our Chiropractor in West Los Angeles Diagnoses &amp; Treats
  Lower Back Pain&nbsp;
</h4>

<p>
  Understanding what factor or factors are contributing to your spinal
  pain can help us devise and implement an appropriate treatment plan
  that will address your needs and your&nbsp;lifestyle and health
  goals. Our chiropractor in West Los Angeles offers several
  techniques to do this, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Chiropractic adjustments, including the tool-assisted Graston
    technique, reduce spasms and scar tissue formation, realign the
    many spinal joints within your back, relieve pressure on spinal
    nerves, and trigger the release of pain mediating transmitters
    within the&nbsp;nervous system to effectively provide back pain
    relief
  </li>
  <li>
    Massage therapy relaxes spasms and can accelerate healing from
    acute and chronic injuries by increasing&nbsp;circulation of
    oxygen-rich blood and lymph fluid
  </li>
  <li>
    Exercises can be prescribed and instructed so that the patient
    will learn how to increase the flexibility, strength, endurance,
    and overall dynamic balance of their postural muscles
  </li>
</ul>
