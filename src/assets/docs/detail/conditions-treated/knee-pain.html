  The knee is a fairly stable hinge&nbsp;joint that is involved in
  just about every weight-bearing task you do throughout the day. When
  knee pain and dysfunction occur, everything from your leisure life
  to your work life can be impacted. Our

<h4><strong>Common Causes of Knee Pain</strong></h4>
<p>
  Knee pain can occur in people of all ages and health backgrounds.
  Some of the most common conditions include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Acute injuries, including ligament sprains, meniscus tears, and
    muscle strains
  </li>
  <li>Tendonitis and bursitis&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    Osteoarthritis, gout,&nbsp;and other types of inflammatory joint
    conditions
  </li>
  <li>
    Referred pain from the hip or even the spine (if a nerve is being
    compressed)
  </li>
  <li>Patellar dislocation</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We see a lot of these conditions in sports. This includes
  patellofemoral pain syndrome, runner&#39;s knee, and iliotibial band
  syndrome. Factors such as overweight, medical and family history,
  overuse, and personal injury can also increase a person&#39;s risk
  for knee pain and dysfunction.
</p>
<h4><strong>Knee Pain Symptoms</strong></h4>
<p>People who complain of knee pain often report symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dull, achy, throbbing, or sore pain</li>
  <li>
    Pain may be diffuse throughout the joint or in one focal area
    (e.g., inside the knee, on the outside of the knee, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    A feeling or sensation of clicking, popping, and instability&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>The knee may occasionally buckle</li>
  <li>
    Increased pain when kneeling, going up stairs, rising from a
    chair, etc.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Swelling and tenderness</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There may also be related conditions such as shortened leg muscles
  (especially the hamstrings, calves, and iliotibial bands), altered
  knee position, and altered hip flexibility/alignment.
