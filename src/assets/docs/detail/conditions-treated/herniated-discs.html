    >About Spinal Disc Herniation&rsquo;s: Symptoms and Causes</strong
  >
</h4>

<p>
  A spinal disc is a gel-filled structure sandwiched in between your
  vertebral bones. These discs provide&nbsp;shock absorption
  and&nbsp;permit&nbsp;mobility&nbsp;within the spinal column.
  Sometimes, typically due to wear and tear or acute injury
  (even&nbsp;seemingly minor &quot;straw that broke the camel&#39;s
  back&quot; injuries), the disc&#39;s&nbsp;inner fluid can leak out
  through a rupture in its&nbsp;outer fibrous layer. This is
  a&nbsp;disc herniation (note that the disc doesn&#39;t &quot;slip
  out of place,&quot; but rather itself&nbsp;becomes injured).&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  A spinal disc herniation&nbsp;may or may not lead to symptoms, and
  it generally depends on the extent of encroachment other nearby
  connective tissue structures, such as nerve, muscle, or ligament. If
  symptoms do develop, they can include: localized tenderness and
  muscle guarding at the level of the herniation, stiffness in the
  spine, decreased the range of motion, and pain, numbness, and
  tingling in an arm or leg.
</p>

<p>
  Disc herniation&rsquo;s are most common in the cervical spine and
  lumbar spine (neck and lower back, respectively). You may be at
  greater risk of sustaining one if you:&nbsp;
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Have a physically demanding job and/or perform frequent lifting
    and moving of heavy objects (especially if you use poor body
    mechanics while doing so!)
  </li>
  <li>Have a history of back injury</li>
  <li>Are overweight</li>
  <li>Are a smoker</li>
  <li>Are a male between the age of 35-50&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
