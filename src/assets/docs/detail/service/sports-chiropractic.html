<p>Athletic&nbsp;injuries can happen to individuals of all ages and ability. Whether you are training for a race, playing tennis or practicing yoga,&nbsp;sports chiropractic&nbsp;care is a safe and effective treatment for managing pain and supporting the injury rehabilitation process. Our&nbsp;West Los Angeles &amp; Westchester chiropractor Dr. Viktorija Joga combines chiropractic care with complementary therapies, including massage therapy, to help patients safely heal after a sports injury.</p>

<h4>Get Back in the Game with Sports Chiropractic</h4>

<p>Knee pain is one of the most common athletic injuries requiring&nbsp;sports chiropractic&nbsp;care. You do not need to be a runner to suffer knee pain. High impact sports, like basketball or soccer, can also damage the connective tissue and nerves in the knee. If you are suffering from chronic knee pain, rehabilitative care is essential to minimizing internal inflammation and swelling. Dr. Joga will also teach you corrective exercises to strengthen the tissues surrounding the knee. These exercises improve stability and balance and will help reduce the risk of future injury.</p>

<p>Tennis elbow, also known as &ldquo;lateral epicondylitis,&rdquo; is soreness or pain on the lateral side of the upper arm. While this injury can be triggered by an improper tennis swing, it is also common for individuals who play golf. This repetitive motion injury can have a devastating effect on mobility, causing a sharp pain and inflammation that makes it difficult to hold or grip objects. The first treatment step is to identify and address the underlying cause. For some patients, a misalignment in the spine may be affecting their ability to properly swing a racket or club. Correcting this misalignment is essential to ensuring proper technique.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;sports chiropractic&nbsp;care, patients with repetitive motion injuries also benefit from massage therapy, which improves blood flow. Sports massage helps to break up scar tissue and bring fresh nutrients to the injured soft tissues. Corrective exercises are also beneficial for patients. These exercises bring mobility back to the elbow without straining the injured tendons or increasing the risk for future injury.</p>

<p>Back pain&nbsp;and&nbsp;neck pain&nbsp;are also common following a sports injury, such as a herniated or slipped disc. If you are experiencing back or&nbsp;neck pain, sports chiropractic&nbsp;care is essential to correcting the underlying spinal misalignment triggering your pain. While some minor neck and back pain&nbsp;may seem to &ldquo;go away&rdquo; on its own, this does not mean that your injury is fully healed. In fact, your body may simply have adjusted its own movements to avoid triggering pain. Continuing to exercise without proper treatment can be very dangerous as you are at risk for additional injury.</p>

<p>As part of our&nbsp;sports chiropractic&nbsp;care services, our chiropractor offers core training. Strengthening the core muscles is essential to stability and balance while exercising, reducing the risk of future athletic injuries. A stronger core also improves posture and enhances athletic performance.</p>
