<p>You may have heard of friends going to a prenatal chiropractor in West Los Angeles, Playa Del Rey, or Culver City and thought that seemed a little excessive. However, visiting us at Joga Chiropractic Center in Westchester is a surprisingly powerful way to improve your health during pregnancy and can even enhance your delivery experience in unexpected ways.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>How Does Prenatal Chiropractic Care Differ From Normal Types?</strong></h4>

<p>When you get specialized prenatal care, your treatments are typically gentler and more focused. For example, you are likely to receive specific manipulations of your pelvic area to improve your delivery. Another way it differs is the certification required by your chiropractic specialists. They should have DACCP and CACCP certification as well as Webster training in achieving pelvic balance during pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Is Prenatal Chiro Treatment Safe for Mother and Child?</strong></h4>

<p>Chiropractors who can give prenatal treatments have been carefully trained to ensure that they don&#39;t injure the mother or child during these procedures. Their manipulations focus on very gentle therapies, such as joint mobilization and soft tissue treatment. As a result, it is possible to get manipulations as often as 2-3 times per week. Many women get postpartum care to ensure that their pelvis stays tight and stable after giving birth.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>What are the Benefits of Visiting a Prenatal Chiropractor in West Los Angeles?</strong></h4>

<p>An unfortunate number of babies in Playa Del Rey and Culver City experience complications during their delivery that can threaten their lives and those of their mother. In fact, a surprising four percent of all births result in a dangerous breach. Thankfully, prenatal chiropractic care can avoid this problem in a variety of ways including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Decreased back, neck, and joint pain&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Lowered time spent in delivery and labor&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Improved alignment of your baby for a more natural delivery&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Reduced risk of a cesarean delivery&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Improved nausea symptoms&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>It achieves all of these benefits by balancing your pelvic alignment and making it easier for you to give birth. Beyond that, it can also help manage any dislocation that occurs during this process and can prevent permanent scarring or a permanently-altered pelvis that makes future deliveries more challenging.&nbsp;</p>
