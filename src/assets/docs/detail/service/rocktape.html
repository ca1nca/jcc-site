  <strong>Our West Los Angeles</strong
  ><strong
    >&nbsp;and Westchester Chiropractor Uses Rock Tape As A
    Chiropractic Treatment For Common Sports Injuries</strong
  >
</p>

<p>
  If you are an athlete struggling with reoccurring injury, then you
  know the importance of wrapping, taping and bracing. RockTape is a
  treatment we like to use to provide our patients with support and
  natural pain relief, durable and flexible enough for any lifestyle
  or activity level. RockTape is most frequently used to help
  professional athletes perform to the best of their abilities, but
  the average patient will benefit just as greatly.
</p>

<h4><strong>What is RockTape?</strong></h4>

<p>
  RockTape is a new therapeutic tape that is commonly used by athletes
  to help treat injuries and enhance performance. It is also called
  Kinesio Tape or Kinesiology Tape. You might have already seen
  RockTape on the shoulder of an NBA player or a tennis pro like
  Serena Williams. The tape typically used by professional athletes
  and Olympians is black and often looks like it wouldn&rsquo;t be
  doing anything helpful, yet the results are amazing. RockTape is
  made of 97% cotton and 3% nylon for a natural-hybrid product.
</p>

<p>
  RockTape was originally created and used by chiropractors in Japan.
  It goes beyond other Kinesiology Tapes, being created specifically
  for athletes in the height of competition. The tape was made to
  withstand extreme conditions and work for any age.
</p>

<h4><strong>How will RockTape Help?</strong></h4>

<p>
  The process uses no drugs, but will alleviate pain and prevent
  injury. The tape is woven so that it only stretches in one
  direction, allowing greater control and support. RockTape is adhered
  to your skin with a hypo-allergenic, latex-free adhesive that lifts
  your skin away from the soft tissue.
</p>

<p>
  The lift is microscopic, but it enables the blood to move into an
  injured area, allowing accelerated healing and recovery. The
  pressure that typically causes irritation in the injured area is
  relieved.
</p>

<p>
  The tape can also be used to correct tracking issues in your elbows,
  shoulders or knees and correcting posture problems.
  Posture-correcting can be especially helpful to pregnant women
  struggling with pregnancy-related posture issues.
</p>

<h4><strong>RockTape for Sports Injuries</strong></h4>

<p>
  The great part about RockTape is that it allows you to continue on
  with your daily routine. Whether you are currently experiencing pain
  from injury, or just prone to a certain type of injury, Kinesio
  Taping can provide a helpful and natural solution that won&rsquo;t
  interfere with your activities. Some of the most common injuries or
  problems treated by RockTape include:

  be worn up to five days. Your taping job will hold up during any
  activity and you will be able to shower, swim and live as if it
