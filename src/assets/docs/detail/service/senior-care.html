<p>
  Dr. Viktorija Joga, our Westchester and West Los Angeles
  &nbsp;chiropractor, provides senior chiropractic care. Dr. Joga is a
  dedicated chiropractor for seniors and she uses gentle adjustments
  to alleviate years of discomfort that are the result of poor
  posture, an untreated injury or the aging process. As your body
  ages, changes occur in areas such as your bones, muscles and
  hormones. These changes can lead to conditions such as osteoporosis
  which increases your risk of injury to your spine or hips. You may
  also be experiencing a recurrence of pain in a condition that
  occurred during your younger years. Regardless of your reasons for
  seeking chiropractor treatments, our Westchester, LA chiropractor
  and the staff at Joga Chiropractic Center want to help you.

  You do not have to accept the ways aging tries to slow down your
  activity level. With chiropractic care your energy is restored, your
  muscles are stronger and your spine supports an increase in physical
  activity. The more you move, the better you feel and as a result,
  your quality of life improves. Our chiropractor for older adults
  uses gentle techniques to help you overcome any barriers to your
  quality of life. Even if you are dealing with chronic conditions
  such as fibromyalgia or diabetes, you can find relief and
  improvement with natural chiropractic care. We may also suggest
  pairing your chiropractic adjustments with other services such as
  massage therapy to reduce muscle tension and enhance blood flow. We
  also offer training programs to strengthen your core to strongly
  support your daily movements.
