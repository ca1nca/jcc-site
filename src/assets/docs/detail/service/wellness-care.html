<h4>How Can Your Chiropractor in West Los Angeles Help?</h4>

<p>How can we help you to see this type of pain relief? To achieve it, you&rsquo;ll meet with your chiropractor in West
    Los Angeles for a thorough examination. We&rsquo;ll focus on creating a customized treatment plan to address the
    underlying cause of your pain. Remember, we want to fix the problem, not just the pain symptoms. We can do this in a
    number of ways:</p>

<p>Chiropractic Care: With the use of chiropractic care, we resolve the most common cause of your pain, a subluxation or
    misalignment of the spinal column. By using gentle force through spinal adjustments, we can fix the pain cause
    &ndash; the pinching of the nerves and compression of the spinal column. This stops the pain and allows the body to
    heal naturally.</p>

<p>Massage Therapy: To stimulate healing in inflamed areas, we&rsquo;ll use massage therapy. The types of massage we use
    help to stimulate an increased amount of blood flow to the area. This helps to encourage the body&rsquo;s natural
    healing methods to work, reducing the pain at its source.</p>

<p>Prenatal Adjustments: We can offer very safer and effective prenatal chiropractic adjustments. These are aimed at
    improving the stress and strain on the body from pregnancy.</p>

<p>Corrective Exercises: We use a number of methods to improve the function of your body and to build up your body&rsquo;s
    core strength. This helps to reduce your pain and stimulates healing while also limiting the risk that your body
    will continue to be in pain.</p>

<p>With a large number of noninvasive and holistic treatment options, we can help you to heal and feel better.</p>
