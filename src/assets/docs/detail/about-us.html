  If you're expecting a baby you may be suffering from back pain,
  swollen ankles, overall pain and fatigue. You'd like to find some
  relief, but may be concerned about using medications or treatments
  that might affect the health of your baby. Our Westchester
  chiropractor, Dr. Viktorija Joga, provides all-natural solutions for
  <strong>prenatal care</strong>. We offer gentle massage therapy to
  help relieve the pain caused by the extra weight pressing on your
  spine and hips. Massage may also result in a shorter, easier labor
  and shorten your hospital stay once your baby arrives. Additionally,
  we recommend core training exercises that could help improve the
  core strength in your abdominal area. Part of prenatal care might
  also include acupuncture to remove any interference in the flow of
  healing energy in your body.

  Core Training and Massage Therapy in&nbsp;Westchester
</h2>
<p>
  Many patients come to our chiropractor seeking<strong>
    core training</strong
  >
  for those muscles deep with the stomach and back. It is important to
  keep these muscles strong and flexible because they help us when we
  sit, stand, exercise and perform all of our daily activities.
  Athletes especially find it important to work on building their core
  strength so they can perform to their maximum ability and reduce the
  likelihood of severe injury. Dr. Joga may recommend physiotherapy
  and conditioning exercises to strengthen your core muscles. She may
  also provide lifestyle advice and nutritional counseling to help
  keep your body at its best.

  Our chiropractor offers <strong>massage therapy</strong> as part of
  a preventative and curative treatment regimen. If you are
  experiencing back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain or some other type
  of pain from a work-related injury or an auto accident injury,
  massage therapy can be used to loosen any tightened muscles, aid in
  the repair of damaged tissues, and help restore your range of
  motion. Some patients experience other health benefits with this
  type of therapy such as enhanced immunity, improved flow of oxygen
  and endorphins, and relief of migraine headaches.

  All of our services - prenatal care, hands-on adjustments and spinal
