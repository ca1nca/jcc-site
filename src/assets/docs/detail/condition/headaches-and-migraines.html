<p>At Joga Chiropractic Center, our Westchester chiropractor understands that headache pain is a sign that there is a problem somewhere in the body. To cover up or mask that important symptom with medication simply makes no sense. Instead, Dr. Viktorija Joga seeks to discover the cause of headaches and prescribe a natural headache or migraine treatment program to provide relief both for the short and long term. We think the more you know about headaches and chiropractic care for migraine relief, the more you&#39;ll want to seek out our common-sense headache relief treatments.</p>

<h4>The Cause of Headaches</h4>

<p>Part of the challenge of prescribing a headache treatment is discovering the root cause of the pain. One such example is that of a tension headache resulting from stress. Patients often feel this headache beginning as tension in the shoulder and neck area that eventually &ldquo;moves&rdquo; to the head. At Joga Chiropractic Center, your chiropractor in West Los Angeles, we know that many times these headaches are caused by a misalignment in the spine that affects the neck and head.</p>

<p>Headaches may also be caused by lighting, smells or foods. Often times, these triggers can be tracked down by monitoring your lifestyle and noting the precursors to headaches. Headaches may be caused by some sort of external trauma like the whiplash of a car accident or sports injury. Pinched nerves, poor posture, and incorrectly aligned vertebrae are also root causes of headaches or migraines. Before an effective migraine or headache treatment can be determined, Dr. Viktorija Joga will first consult with you about your lifestyle and recent events that may have led to your headaches. She&#39;ll then conduct physical, postural, and/or range of motion tests to better determine the root cause and to prescribe the proper headache treatment for you.</p>
