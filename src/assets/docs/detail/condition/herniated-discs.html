<h2><strong>About Spinal Disc Herniation&rsquo;s: Symptoms and Causes</strong></h2>

<p>A spinal disc is a gel-filled structure sandwiched in between your vertebral bones. These discs provide&nbsp;shock absorption and&nbsp;permit&nbsp;mobility&nbsp;within the spinal column. Sometimes, typically due to wear and tear or acute injury (even&nbsp;seemingly minor &quot;straw that broke the camel&#39;s back&quot; injuries), the disc&#39;s&nbsp;inner fluid can leak out through a rupture in its&nbsp;outer fibrous layer. This is a&nbsp;disc herniation (note that the disc doesn&#39;t &quot;slip out of place,&quot; but rather itself&nbsp;becomes injured).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spinal disc herniation&nbsp;may or may not lead to symptoms, and it generally depends on the extent of encroachment other nearby connective tissue structures, such as nerve, muscle, or ligament. If symptoms do develop, they can include: localized tenderness and muscle guarding at the level of the herniation, stiffness in the spine, decreased the range of motion, and pain, numbness, and tingling in an arm or leg.</p>

<p>Disc herniation&rsquo;s are most common in the cervical spine and lumbar spine (neck and lower back, respectively). You may be at greater risk of sustaining one if you:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Have a physically demanding job and/or perform frequent lifting and moving of heavy objects (especially if you use poor body mechanics while doing so!)</li>
	<li>Have a history of back injury</li>
	<li>Are overweight</li>
	<li>Are a smoker</li>
	<li>Are a male between the age of 35-50&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
