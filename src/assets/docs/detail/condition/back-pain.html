  />Back pain can feel excruciating and make you feel more exhausted
  and weak than you normally would throughout your regular daily
  activities. The reality is, back pain is very common and can occur
  as a result of bad sleeping habits, poor posture, overstraining your
  muscles or from an injury. Although you can take certain pain
  medications to numb and relieve the pain in your back, these pills
  will not treat the actual cause of the pain: inflammation. The good
  news is, you can have lower back pain relief by receiving regular
  treatments from a chiropractor in West Los Angeles and Westchester.

<h4>
  What Is Causing Your Lower Back Pain and How It Can Be Alleviated
</h4>

<p>
  Is your sitting posture affecting the health of your back? If you
  experience chronic back pain and discomfort, your posture could very
  well be a culprit. Having poor posture when you sit at a desk or
  table could cause a lot of strain and pressure on the tendons,
  muscles, nerves and in your back. Many different professions require
  a lot of sitting, which makes you more prone to back pain caused by
  poor posture.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Back pain caused by injuries can be serious. If your back hurts
  after a fall or after you have been lifting something heavy, you
  could have damaged the nerves in your spine, overstrained your
  muscles or ruptured your discs. All of these injuries can worsen if
  left untreated. Chiropractic treatments can complement any other
  medical care you may already have, and can help your injuries heal
  more quickly. Best of all, you can experience dramatic lower back
  pain relief by reducing the inflammation in and around the vertebrae
  and cartilage in your back. This will allow you to get back to your
  normal activities faster, with a lot less pain and more flexibility.

  When you visit a licensed chiropractor in West Los Angeles and
  Westchester, we will examine your spine to evaluate your condition,
  which will let us know exactly what type of adjustments and
  treatments you should receive in order to eliminate your back pain.
  It is extremely important to tell the chiropractic clinic about any
  other health problems you have and whether or not you have
  experienced any recent injuries or accidents. Some health conditions
  do not always appear on MRIs, X-rays or CT scans, like back injuries
  from a car accident, but you can successfully treat your pain with
  treatments from a chiropractor once a proper diagnosis has been
  made.
