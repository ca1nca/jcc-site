<p>Pinched nerves can put the squeeze on every aspect of your life, from everyday comfort and enjoyment of your favorite activities to your ability to perform your job. When nerve tissues become impinged by some other structure in the body, pain, motor control problems, and other upsetting neurological symptoms often follow. But if you&#39;re worried that a pinched nerve problem may drive you toward major surgery, take heart. Joga&nbsp;Chiropractic Center can provide safe, non-invasive treatment options to relieve the pressure on pinched nerves, restoring your physical control and eliminating your discomfort.</p>

<h2>Understanding Nerve Impingement</h2>

<p>Your nervous system is a complex network of nerves and nerves roots, all of which branch off from the spinal cord. The spinal cord and nerve roots are surrounded by various parts of the spinal column, including vertebrae and vertebral discs, with the nerve roots making their way through small spaces between these structures. It doesn&#39;t take much to shift one of these components onto a major nerve root. The resulting pressure limits the nerve root&#39;s ability to conduct signals to any or all of the nerves attached to it, just as squeezing a garden hose near the faucet can stop&nbsp;the flow of water to an entire sprinkler system. This can cause some very strange and debilitating symptoms such as shooting pains, &quot;electric&quot; tingling sensations, loss of sensation, and loss of function to various parts of the body.</p>

<p>What circumstances might cause a pinched nerve? The condition is commonly associated with:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight gain </strong>- Both obesity and pregnancy can encourage lumbar nerve impingement.</li>
	<li><strong>Injuries </strong>- Injuries can force vertebrae and discs out of position so that they press against nerves. Chronic injuries can also impinge nerves if tissues around the nerve swell up.</li>
	<li><strong>Degenerative conditions</strong> - Bone spurs, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis,&nbsp;and bulging discs can all contribute to nerve impingement.</li>
	<li><strong>Spinal alignment problems</strong> - Any condition that allows the spine to fall out of alignment can lead to nerve root compression.</li>
</ul>
