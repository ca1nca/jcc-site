<h1 align="center"><strong>Shoulder Pain in Los Angeles, CA</strong></h1>

<p>Shoulder pain is common thanks to the wide range of motion of these ball joints and the amount of use they get. This combination makes it easy to put excessive strain on them, cause inflammation, or overuse them. Here are some of the common causes of shoulder pain and what type of shoulder pain treatment a chiropractor in West Los Angeles can provide for relief.</p>

<h2><strong>Dislocated Shoulder</strong></h2>

<p>A dislocated shoulder&nbsp;involves the displacement of the shoulder joint&#39;s ball from its socket. It can happen in either total or partial forms. Both cause extreme pain, swelling, and an inability to move the shoulder.</p>

<p>A chiropractor uses the standard treatment&nbsp;to gently manipulate the shoulder&#39;s parts back into their proper position &ndash; and bone manipulation is the mainstay of the chiropractor. Once the&nbsp;shoulder is back in place, the vast majority of the pain should immediately end. Many people who&#39;ve had a dislocated shoulder&nbsp;may wear a sling for a while in order to let the soft tissues heal. Strengthening exercises are then used to help prevent repeat dislocations.</p>

<h2>Soft Tissue Problems</h2>

<p>This often presents in the form of&nbsp;<strong>bursitis.</strong>&nbsp;In the shoulder and other joints, there are fluid-filled sacs called bursae that provide some cushioning. When they get inflamed or infected, painful bursitis results.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rotator cuff injuries</strong>, which involve the muscles and tendons surrounding the shoulder joint, often result from repetitive overhead motions. They result in deep pain, limited range of motion, and similar symptoms. Fortunately, corrective exercise usually resolves the problem.</li>
	<li><strong>Shoulder tendinitis</strong>&nbsp;is the inflammation of the tendons in the shoulder area. Soft tissue treatments, and possibly joint manipulation, relieves pain from this problem and helps reduce the inflammation.</li>
	<li><strong>Strains and sprains</strong>&nbsp;involve the overstretching of the tendons and ligaments. Massage therapy and other soft tissue treatments speed healing and help with mobility.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Frozen Shoulder</strong></h2>

<p>This is a unique problem that is also known as adhesive&nbsp;capsulitis. It is often caused by prolonged periods of shoulder immobility that are brought on by other medical conditions.</p>

<p>Typically, stiffness and pain develop slowly, reach a peak known as the frozen stage, and then slowly recede over the course of one to three years. Pain is usually at its worst during the first stage, which is the freezing stage. However, the frozen stage is the one with the most limited motion. The pain and duration of this condition can be helped with corrective exercises and other soft tissue treatments.</p>
