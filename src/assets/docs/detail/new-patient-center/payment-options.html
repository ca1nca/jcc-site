  <p>
    Joga Chiropractic Center believes in the value of chiropractic
    care for you and your family toward the goal of achieving total
    health and wellness. Therefore, we have created a pricing
    structure that is flexible enough to allow you to get the
    chiropractic care you need, no matter what your budget. Our
    chiropractic office participates in most insurance programs, but
    please call us at <strong>424-800-2488</strong> if you have any
    questions about whether you can use your insurance to pay for your
    chiropractic care. We also accept auto accident and workers
    compensation cases that result in back pain, headaches or other
    symptoms which can be addressed with chiropractic care. For
    patients who have little or no chiropractic insurance coverage,
    flexible payment programs can be arranged. To learn more about our
    payment options for chiropractic and wellness care, you can call
    our Los Angeles chiropractic office directly at
    <strong>424-800-2488</strong> and one of our friendly staff will
    be happy to answer all your questions.

  <h3>Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    Most insurance plans are accepted at our chiropractic office. We
    accept auto accident, workers compensation, personal injury cases
    that have resulted in back pain, neck pain, headaches, or other
    related pain conditions. We also except most health insurance
    plans, including Medicare. Because there are so many insurance
    plans out there, and because coverage for chiropractic care varies
    widely, please call us to find out if your plan covers care in our
    office. Before you start a chiropractic care plan, our staff would
    be happy to verify your benefits and explain them to you at no
    charge.
  </p>
  <h3>No Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    Our goal at Joga Chiropractic Center is to allow everyone to
    experience the benefits of chiropractic care and adjustments. For
    patients who have little or no chiropractic insurance coverage, we
    can work with you to arrange a flexible payment program that fits
    your budget. If you have no insurance or if your insurance does
    not have any chiropractic benefits, there are still ways for you
    to receive the pain relief and chiropractic care that you need.
    Many patients choose to pay directly for their visits with the
    chiropractor, especially as they discover that chiropractic care
    is actually extremely cost-effective and affordable. For these
    patients, chiropractic care is often cheaper and more effective
    than alternative pain treatments such as pain medications or
    invasive surgery.

  <h3>Family Plans</h3>
  <p>
    Our focus at Joga Chiropractic Center is to actively&nbsp;help you
    and&nbsp;your family in taking responsibility for your total
    health, wellness, and disease management. Our chiropractor will
    assist and guide you as you take the time to care for some of the
    most important people in your world: you and your family.&nbsp; In
    an effort to make living the wellness lifestyle as easy and
    affordable as possible, we&nbsp;can create a customized family
    chiropractic plan that is&nbsp;specific to you and your family.

  <h3>Health on a Budget with Chiropractic Care</h3>
  <p>
    At Joga Chiropractic Center in Los Angeles, we are convinced that
    chiropractic care will help you stay healthy and pain-free, using
    only a small amount of your time and money. Our chiropractic
    health professionals will help you care for your most important
    asset--your health. We truly believe the prevention is the best
    cure, and regular chiropractic care will be far less time
    consuming and expensive than trying to recover from pain or an
    injury after it&#39;s happened.&nbsp;If you feel you do not have
    enough time or money to take care of yourself, please contact us
    at 424-800-2488--we can help!&nbsp; The last thing we want is for
    you to come to our chiropractic center in crisis. So please, we
    would like to encourage you to take your health very
    seriously.&nbsp; As the old saying goes, if you don&#39;t have
    your health, you don&#39;t have anything.&nbsp; Unfortunately, too
    many people don&#39;t discover how true that statement is until it
    is too late.
