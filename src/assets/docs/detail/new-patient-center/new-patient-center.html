<h4>
  <strong>Visiting Our Westchester Chiropractor&nbsp;</strong>
</h4>
<p>
  To best serve the needs of our community, we accent clients during
  our business hours: Monday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Wednesday
  from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Friday from 7:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., and
  Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Not only do we provide chiropractic care for accidents, sports
  injuries, back pain, and more, we help you improve&nbsp;your fitness
  so you&nbsp;are&nbsp;less likely to injure yourself in the future.
  Our focus on core strengthening makes us unique among wellness
  providers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We also offer acupuncture, to complement chiropractic and heal
  internal injuries, and low laser light therapy for soft tissue
  healing. These complementary therapies will&nbsp;heal&nbsp;your
  health complaint faster so you&nbsp;feel less pain&nbsp;in between
  appointments&nbsp;and achieve your wellness objectives.&nbsp;

    >Preparing For Your First Appointment With Our Chiropractor In
    Westchester</strong
  >
</h4>
<p>
  We have an online form library, so you can print and complete
  appointment paperwork at home. The New Patient Health History Form
  is required and gives you a chance to tell us about your wellness
  goals. The Member Wellness Registration Form is optional, but allows
  you to access member resources that can help you on your health
  journey.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  While the membership form is optional, we highly recommend it. We
  have pulled together a lot of helpful information on the Joga
  Chiropractic Center website that can help you learn about your
  health, your needs, positive lifestyle changes, and your optimal
  well-being.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  If you seek to truly transform your health and wellness, not just
  end back pain, then you need our help. We have done the work of
  finding reliable information and presenting it to you in an easy to
  understand manner. If you become a free member of our wellness
  center, you will get all the latest health tips, receive support on
  your wellness journey, and learn how to take care of your most
  valuable asset - your body.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a comfortable reception area, so that you may relax
  while you wait to be called. Our reception staff are here to help
  you schedule your next appointment or to answer any insurance
  questions. We accept most insurance plans, and can discuss your
  level of benefits with you.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not have chiropractic insurance, do not worry: We have a
  number of flexible payment plans and a unique payment structure.
  This can help you achieve the care you seek at a price you can
  afford.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Is there anything we can assist you with before your appointment? We
  encourage you to contact our chiropractor in Westchester&nbsp;at
  <strong>424-800-2488</strong> with any questions. We look forward to
  helping you on your journey toward improved health and wellness and
  cannot wait to meet you!&nbsp;
