<h4>Types of Auto Accident Injuries Treated&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
  Injuries sustained from a car collision are not always visible to
  the naked eye. Internal injuries may be present, but may cause no
  pain or other symptoms. However, untreated injuries can lead to
  severe health complications. These are common auto accident injuries
  that we treat:
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Concussions</li>
    <li>Contusions</li>
    <li>Whiplash</li>
    <li>Neck and back injuries</li>
    <li>Herniated or bulging discs</li>
    <li>Vertebrae fracture&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Muscle strains, sprains, or tears&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Spinal misalignment&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Typical Symptoms after a Car Collision&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
  The following symptoms may develop right away or days or weeks
  later. For example, patients who suffered a whiplash may not notice
  symptoms until 24 hours or more after the initial trauma.
</p>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Neck pain or stiffness</li>
    <li>Upper or lower back pain</li>
    <li>Shoulder pain</li>
    <li>Headaches or dizziness</li>
    <li>Swelling and inflammation&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Sciatica (nerve pain)</li>
    <li>Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs</li>
    <li>Muscle pain or weakness</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Diagnosing Your Pain and Injuries&nbsp;</h4>
<p>
  Our chiropractor will examine you thoroughly for head, neck, and
  back injuries. Non-obvious injuries to the spinal bones, joints,
  discs, and connective tissue may show up on an X-ray, CT scan, or
  MRI.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
  Auto Accident Injury Care by Our Westchester Chiropractor&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
  Your pain management plan could include these safe non-surgical
  treatments that may help prevent invasive surgery:
</p>
<p class="p-indented">
  <strong>Chiropractic adjustment:</strong> Adjusting the spine with
  gentle manipulation force helps to restore the spinal joints and
  discs to their natural position. Spinal adjustment relieves pressure
  on the nerves and eases the pain caused by pinched or compressed
  nerves. Blood and nutrient flow to the spine are also
  restored.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="p-indented">
  <strong>Massage therapy:</strong>&nbsp;Soft tissue injuries such as
  muscle sprain, strains, and soreness can be effectively relieved
  with our soothing massage therapy. Massages activate the body's
  natural pain relievers and support healing by reducing inflammation
  and improving blood circulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="p-indented">
  <strong>Corrective exercises: </strong>The aim of corrective
  exercises is to strengthen your back and core muscles so they can
  keep the spine stable. Your pain will gradually fade away as your
  muscles become stronger.
