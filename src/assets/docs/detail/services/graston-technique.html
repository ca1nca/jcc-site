  <h2>Graston Technique&reg;</h2>
  <h2>Treatment from Your Westchester Chiropractor</h2>
</header>

<p>
  Even seemingly simple soft tissue injuries such as a muscle strain
  in the back can cause immobility and even excruciating pain.&nbsp;
  One of the forms of manual therapy our chiropractor in Westchester,
  CA uses with instruments to treat these injuries is Graston
  Technique treatment.&nbsp; This technique has brought relief to many
  patients from the Westchester, Culver City, West Los Angeles, Playa
  Vista, and Playa Del Rey areas.

<h4>Overview of the Graston Technique Treatment</h4>

<p>
  Graston Technique therapy uses manual movements plus instruments to
  treat soft tissue injuries.&nbsp; Its purpose is to help identify
  areas where you have restricted movement and to break up any scar
  tissue.&nbsp; The technique treats restrictions by stretching your
  connective tissue and rearranging soft tissue such as tendons,
  ligaments, muscles, and fascia.&nbsp; A majority of scar tissue and
  restrictions to fascia are the result of some type of soft tissue
  trauma, such as a pulled ligament or tendon.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Like other types of manual treatments, the Graston Technique also
  provides you with a neurologic benefit.&nbsp; It activates specific
  nerve fibers and stimulates a reaction from organs that sense
  position.&nbsp; Chiropractors can utilize it by itself or with other
  therapies.
</p>

<p>
  The primary soft tissue structures in your back are muscles,
  ligaments, tendons, and fascia.&nbsp; Injury to any of them can
  cause considerable pain and dysfunction.&nbsp; If you have a soft
  tissue injury, Graston therapy could offer you these benefits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decreased total treatment time</li>
  <li>Faster rehabilitation and recovery</li>
  <li>Avoiding anti-inflammatory drugs</li>
  <li>
    Achieving resolution to conditions previously consider permanent
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  This therapy uses a combination of handheld instruments and a
  specific massage technique to break up scar tissue and increase
  blood flow to areas of injury.&nbsp; Our doctor uses it to treat a
  number of conditions, among them:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Achilles tendon injuries</li>
  <li>Shin splints</li>
  <li>Muscle strains or sprains in the lower back</li>
  <li>Cervical strain/sprain</li>
  <li>Rotator cuff tendinosis</li>
  <li>Tennis or golfer&rsquo;s elbow</li>
  <li>Runner&rsquo;s knee</li>
  <li>Carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to Expect from This Westchester Treatment</h4>

<p>
  At your initial consultation, our chiropractor in Westchester will
  conduct a physical exam and discuss your health history.&nbsp; After
  making a diagnosis, our doctor will determine whether the Graston
  Technique is the right treatment for your soft tissue injury.
</p>

<p>
  Each treatment session lasts around seven minutes.&nbsp; Our
  chiropractor uses two instruments.&nbsp; The first is a steel device
  with a concave curve to help identify and smooth areas of soft
  tissue that require treatment.&nbsp; The second device has a convex
  curve to focus on specific areas that have been injured, among them
  small areas such as the base of a tendon or larger sections such as
  the calf.
</p>

<p>
  After applying a lotion or cream, our doctor lightly massages the
  selected area.&nbsp; Using broad strokes with the concave device,
  our chiropractor loosens connective tissue.&nbsp; This device finds
  and smooths lumps in soft tissue each time it passes over
  them.&nbsp; Although you can expect to experience a sensation of
  scraping, you should not feel pain.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  Switching to the convex device stretches tissue to relieve pain and
  boost function.&nbsp; Any discomfort usually disappears by the third
  or fourth session.
