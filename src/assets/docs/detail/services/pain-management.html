<h4>The Nagging Problem of Chronic Pain</h4>
<p>
  Acute pain may feel agonizingly intense, but at least it goes away
  sooner or later. Pain from a surgical procedure,&nbsp;acute injury,
  or infection will eventually resolve as the physical
  problem&nbsp;behind it heals up. But some conditions continue for
  months, years, or even indefinitely, and the pain they cause lingers
  as well. You may experience chronic pain due to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Bulging or herniated discs that compress major nerves, causing
    pain signals to shoot through the body
  </li>
  <li>Degenerated or arthritic joints</li>
  <li>
    Muscle strain and inflammation related to postural/alignment
    problems or repetitive motion injuries
  </li>
  <li>Muscle spasms that cause recurring tension headaches</li>
  <li>
    A chronic pain syndrome such as fibromyalgia or myofascial pain
    syndrome
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Since some&nbsp;underlying causes of chronic pain, such as
  osteoarthritis, are progressive and irreversible, the goal is to
  manage that pain as effectively as possible. In other cases, it may
  actually be possible&nbsp;to alleviate longstanding chronic pain by
  correcting a structural problem that's pinching nerves or straining
  muscles. Either way, many sufferers think that they have to turn to
  drugs or surgery to achieve their hoped-for results. But surgery
  causes its own share of pain and&nbsp;damage, with no guarantee that
  the pain you want to resolve will go away. Drugs cannot do much more
  than tame the worst of your symptoms partially and temporarily.
